// use vscode find function to replace all each row and columns
// answer: 4776
// not ideal way to arrive at a solution
// for example you can set up a function that can save the text into matrix
// using direction of the initial horse, iterate and count the piece moved all the way until you face a block/
// if you face a block don't stop counting and change direction
// if you hit one of the edge and pass through (the edge piece arrived was dot) then finish counting
